    Description: CogPonder is a flexible, differentiable model of cognitive control inspired by the Test-Operate-Test-Exit (TOTE) architecture in psychology and the PonderNet framework in deep learning. It decouples the act of control from the controlled processes by introducing a controller that wraps around any end-to-end deep learning model. This controller decides when to terminate processing and output a response, thus producing both a response and response time.

    CogEnv is a virtual environment based on [AndroidEnv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13231) that allows artificial agents to complete the same tests used in human studies. It enables typical reinforcement learning agents to perform tasks commonly used in cognitive psychology, such as the N-Back and Stroop tests. CogEnv is designed to be a flexible and extensible platform for studying [a wide range of cognitive tests](/assessments/index.qmd) and comparing the performance of artificial agents to human participants.

    We used large language models to parse a large corpus of scientific documents about cognitive control and investigate the meaning and relationships between cognitive constructs on the one hand, and assessment instruments (i.e., cognitive tests) on the other. CogText performs automated text analyses on 385,705 scientific texts and creates a joint representation of cognitive control tests and constructs.

  description: |
    Behaverse comprises a large battery of cognitive tests covering a wide range of domains, including attentional, perceptual, cognitive and motor abilities. This battery consists of multiple cognitive assessments which are highly customizable (including the instructions, tutorials, and practice blocks). By configuring a specific cognitive assessment it is possible to instantiate many different cognitive tests.

  description: |
    Asking people questions is a major research method in behavioral and social sciences, be it via standardized questionnaires (e.g., a personality questionnaire) or context sensitive, targeted questions (e.g., experience sampling).
    
    We created a questionnaire data model (decoupling the data structures and backend from the survey viewer). This allows us to display questions on different devices (e.g., survey in a web browser, an experience sampling prompt within a mobile video game) while maintaining coherent data structures, which greatly facilitates their processing and subsequent analyses.
    
    We also curated a list of questionnaires that we modified to increase consistency and data quality. We also developed software to distribute our questionnaires online while being GDPR compliant, multilingual, and supporting the collection of event data (e.g., key strokes, mouse trajectory) using a consistent data model. Finally, we developed a questionnaire response data model to facilitate and streamline the analysis of questionnaire response data.

    There are increasing amounts of behavioral data freely available on the internet with metadata standards making it easier to find them. However, there are large inconsistencies in the way those datasets are structured and stored, in the way their variables are named and formatted and even in what is meant by various common terms. These inconsistencies make it unnecessarily hard to reuse datasets and prevent the development of effective software tools and automatization.
    
    The L1 behavioral data model defines concepts and best practices regarding the naming and structuring as well as coherent data models for cognitive tests.

    Questionnaires are perhaps the most commonly used tool to collect data in social sciences. And while much work has gone into improving the design of questionnaires, comparatively little effort has gone in defining how data collected via questionnaires should be structured, stored and shared. In this standard we propose to organize questionnaire response data in a way that is consistent with the L1 behavioral test data standard but very different from the way such data is typically structured in publicly available datasets.

    Currently, the procedures in behavioral experimental studies are described as text in research papers. We propose to extend BPMN to formally describe experimental procedures (i.e., the flow of participants across activities within a study). This ensures completeness and consistency, and supports the development of new software tools (e.g., for visualizing studies or analyzing data).

    An R package (and proto-standard) to support the automated execution of data analysis code on a large number of files. A key goal is to separate the code that does the data analysis from the code that orchestrates the application of that code to data files and the management of the resulting output files. This project also offers ideas on how to organize data analysis code and output files to ensure traceability and reproducibility.
