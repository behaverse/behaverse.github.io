						<p>Contrary to existing off-the-shelf solutions, our in-house survey system is GDPR compliant, multilingual, supports the collection of event data (e.g., key strokes, mouse trajectory), uses a consistent data model across all use-cases and decouples data structures and backend architectures from the survey viewer (front-end). This allows us to display questions on different devices (e.g., survey in a web browser, an experience sampling prompt within a mobile video game) while maintaining coherent data structures, which greatly facilitates their processing and subsequent analyses.</p>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-6 col-planet">
								<p>There are increasing amounts of behavioral data freely available on the internet with metadata standards making it easier to find them. However, there are large inconsistencies in the way those datasets are structured and stored, in the way their variables are named and formatted and even in what is meant by various common terms. These inconsistencies make it unnecessarily hard to reuse datasets and prevent the development of effective software tools and automatization.</p>
								<p>Behaverse defines coherent data models for both cognitive tests and surveys that apply to a large range of use-cases. In addition, Behaverse defines concepts and best practices regarding the naming and structuring of datasets.</p>

						<p>In Behaverse, data can flow in from many sources and in many different shapes. The Telemetry Platform helps us collect high-throughput behavioral data from participants and carry it straight to the data center of the University of Luxembourg. To enforce data protection and reliability, the system intentionally avoids using third-party online services.</p>
						<p>Moreover, our various technology-specific codebases allow us to support many devices and use-cases, including mobile games and web applications. Nested within each of these data collecting applications, a Telemetry client module mitigates potential connectivity issues and ensures that data is effectively and reliably transferred to the platform.</p>

						<h4 class="planet-icon-GC planet-icon-experiments planet-icon">Game Control</h4>
						<p>Game Control is a powerful set of tools that allows experimenters to flexibly control trial-based activities, be it using procedural generation methods, presets or by specifying trial parameters extensively.</p>
						<p>Within this framework, a game experience is structured in game blocks (e.g., instructions, tutorials, practice, test), each describing a set of parameters, that can be either fixed, sampled from a distribution, or generated using a specific algorithm. Blocks can define adaptive algorithms, which update one or more parameters based on the participant’s past performance.</p>
					</div>
					<hr/>
					<div class="container-fluid section-planet">
						<h4 class="planet-icon-SC planet-icon-experiments planet-icon">Survey Control</h4>
						<p>Survey Control is a set of tools that allow experimenters to flexibly control surveys, first by allowing them to compose questionnaires from a database of questions and response options, second by offering the possibility to quickly compose surveys from pre-existing questionnaires and finally by the use of a dedicated syntax which supports more complex conditional branching schemes (e.g., a participant will see different questions depending on their responses to past questions).</p>
					</div>
					<hr/>
					<div class="container-fluid section-planet">
						<h4 class="planet-icon-SO planet-icon-experiments planet-icon">Study Orchestrator</h4>
						<p>Designed with extensibility and interoperability in mind, the Study Orchestrator lets experimenters configure and oversee the flow of participants across a sequence of activities within their study. Each step of the sequence can lead to branching a user off into another path, depending on the study requirements. Branching can be fine-tuned to allow a wide range of behaviour, from load balancing coverage across groups, to custom assignments of participants to experimental groups.</p>
						<p>The Study Orchestrator also offers a testing website that people can log into to participate in a study. It handles user authentication, resuming participation in the study, and provides experimenters with a dashboard summarizing the progress of the study.</p>
						<p>With a seamless integration with the online participant recruitment platform <a href="https://www.prolific.co/">Prolific</a>, the Study Orchestrator provides an all-in-one solution for quickly creating and publishing complex, adaptive online experiments.</p>

Analytics will support automated data analyses using continuous integration tools, meaning that analyses will be triggered each time the data or the data analysis code is updated.</p>
						<p>In addition to scalability (i.e., the resource efficient analysis of large datasets), Analytics aims to increase the quality of the analysis of our data, first by defining and implementing standardized, transparent and reproducible procedures, second by using state-of-the-art data analysis and machine learning methods (e.g., PyTorch) and finally by offering the possibility to automatically reanalyse past data as models are updated.</p>

Prototypes of dummy robots (acting randomly) have been implemented to generate data for subsequent data quality and system integrity checks. In the future we will interface with state-of-the-art RL agents libraries (e.g., <a href="https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/">stable-baselines</a>), as comparing the performance of those robots with humans may provide invaluable insights into how the human mind works.</p>

					<div class="container-fluid section-planet">
						<h4 class="planet-icon-MC planet-icon-models planet-icon">Computational models of cognition</h4>
						<p>Currently at the concept stage, Computational models of cognition aims to provide a framework and software tools to support integrative and cumulative efforts in modeling cognition.</p>
						<p>It will contain a library of models implemented in various programming languages but following the same API. These models will be available on <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and <a href="https://sylabs.io">Singularity</a> so they can run on the <a href="https://hpc.uni.lu/">High Performance Computing</a> clusters of the University of Luxembourg.</p>
						<p>The models will be tested and compared using common metrics and datasets, which will be collected within Behaverse. Following the principles of continuous integration, each time new datasets are collected, all applicable models will be tested on those new datasets. Similarly as new models are introduced, they will be tested on all available relevant datasets and compared to the other models in the library.</p>
						<p>This setting allows modelers to develop their models in their tools of choice, to more objectively and easily test the performance and scope of their models, while offering the possibility to share their models with the community (either with or without access to the source code).</p>
						<p>Further tools will be needed for example, to explore results (e.g., dashboards) and tinker with the various models (e.g., notebooks). We believe this type of system is necessary both to promote modeling and to get a clearer sense of where we currently stand as a field.</p>
					</div>
					<hr/>
					<div class="container-fluid section-planet">
						<h4 class="planet-icon-PE planet-icon-models planet-icon">Psych Engine</h4>
						<p>The ultimate goal of Behaverse is to construct a “Psych Engine” (in analogy to the physics engine in video games) which will integrate all of our knowledge of the human cognitive system. The Psych Engine should be able to use a person’s historic data to simulate that person’s cognitive system and make non-trivial predictions about how that specific person would perform in various cognitive tests or games. In other words, the Psych Engine would instantiate a “digital twin” of a person’s cognitive system.</p>
						<p>In addition to the scientific value of creating such a system, the Psych Engine may be used both to guide experiments to further our understanding of cognition (e.g., by pointing out predictions with high uncertainty), suggest interventions to help people improve their cognitive abilities and for diagnostics (e.g., unexpected performance drops in specific cognitive abilities may be indicative of a specific neurological issue).</p>
