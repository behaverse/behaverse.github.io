# The Behaverse project
Behaverse is a collection of integrated projects and software systems designed to accelerate, integrate and scale-up cognitive science research to yield scientific discoveries and innovation while promoting best practices and open science. 
 
Behaverse comprises several “galaxies” which are collections of projects around a common theme. Behaverse is under continuous development: the amount of progress differs across projects, and some projects may exist only as prototypes or internal tools. 

In this website we introduce the main Behaverse galaxies and provide links to their main projects.
