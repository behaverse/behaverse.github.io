This allows us to display questions on different devices (e.g., survey in a web browser, an experience sampling prompt within a mobile video game) while maintaining coherent data structures, which greatly facilitates their processing and subsequent analyses. We also curated a list of questionnaires that we modified to increase consistency and data quality. We also developed software to distribute our questionnaires online while being GDPR compliant, multilingual, and supporting the collection of event data (e.g., key strokes, mouse trajectory) using a consistent data model. Finally, we developed a questionnaire response data model to facilitate and streamline the analysis of questionnaire response data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can learn more about this project here.\n\n\n\n\n\nGames\nVideo Games that collect behavioral data can support various forms of assessment.

However, there are large inconsistencies in the way those datasets are structured and stored, in the way their variables are named and formatted and even in what is meant by various common terms. These inconsistencies make it unnecessarily hard to reuse datasets and prevent the development of effective software tools and automatization.\nThe L1 behavioral data model defines concepts and best practices regarding the naming and structuring as well as coherent data models for cognitive tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can learn more about this project here.\n\n\n\n\n\nL1 data standard for questionnaires\nQuestionnaires are perhaps the most commonly used tool to collect data in social sciences. And while much work has gone into improving the design of questionnaires, comparatively little effort has gone in defining how data collected via questionnaires should be structured, stored and shared. In this standard we propose to organize questionnaire response data in a way that is consistent with the L1 behavioral test data standard but very different from the way such data is typically structured in publicly available datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can learn more about this project here.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent data standard (v0)\nWe developed a standard for structuring event data across cognitive tests, questionnaires, and video games. We will likely iterate over this standard or adopt existing standards before sharing it publicly.\n\n\nStudyFlow standard (prototype)\nCurrently, the procedures in behavioral experimental studies are described as text in research papers. We propose to extend BPMN to describe studies (i.e., the flow of participants across activities within a study) more formally. This allows to ensure completeness and consistency but also the use and development of new software tools (e.g., for visualizing studies or analyzing data).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can learn more about this project here."
