## Cognitive tests

Behaverse is a collection of integrated projects and software systems designed to accelerate, integrate and scale-up cognitive science research to yield scientific discoveries and innovation while promoting best practices and open science. 
 
Behaverse comprises several “galaxies” which organize a collection of projects around a common theme. Behaverse is under continuous development: the amount of progress differs across projects, and some projects may exist only as prototypes or internal tools. 

Below we present the main Behaverse galaxies and their main projects.
